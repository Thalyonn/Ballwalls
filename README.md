# General Usage
1. When using the app, you can spawn individual balls along an X and Y coordinate
2. Enter the speed variable with speeds from 1 to 6 (Note: higher speeds can cause tunneling)
3. Enter an angle value

# Other Spawning Options
There are other spawning options including Adding Balls along A Line, Adding Balls along Angle, and Adding Balls along speed. These are selectable as B1, B2, and B3 respectively and allow multiple balls to spawn at once with different conditions through a start and end range.

The user also has the option to spawn walls by giving a start (X, Y) coordinate, and an end coordinate.
